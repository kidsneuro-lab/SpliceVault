What is SpliceVault-40K?,"SpliceVault-40K houses our resource of the most common cryptic donor mis-splicing events local to the exon-intron junction, based on unannotated splice-junctions detected across 40,233 publicly available RNA-Seq samples from GTEx and Intropolis, and built in GRCh37 (40K-RNA).

See Dawes et al. 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-29271-y) for details on formation of the 40K-RNA database"
How was the canonical transcript chosen for each gene?,"GRCh37
Ensembl - Canonical transcript as provided by Ensembl. Ensembl API derives this based on legacy canonical transcript selection rules*
Refseq - Canonical transcript not provided. Calculated using Ensembl’s legacy canonical transcript selection rules*

* The canonical transcript is used in the gene tree analysis in Ensembl and does not necessarily reflect the most biologically relevant transcript of a gene. For human, the canonical transcript for a gene is set according to the following hierarchy: 1. Longest CCDS translation with no stop codons. 2. If no (1), choose the longest Ensembl/Havana merged translation with no stop codons. 3. If no (2), choose the longest translation with no stop codons. 4. If no translation, choose the longest non-protein-coding transcript (Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20200928022822/https://m.ensembl.org/Help/Glossary?id=521)"
What are GTEx and Intropolis?,"GTEx provide RNA-Seq data from a large set of healthy individuals. 
Intropolis is a set of ~42M exon-exon junctions found across 21,504 human RNA-seq samples from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA)."
How is cryptic distance calculated?,"cryptic distance refers to the number of nucleotides between the G of the annotated-donor (GT) or acceptor (AG) and the G of the cryptic donor or acceptor. If 'donor' is selected in generating the table, only cryptic donors will be shown and vice versa."
What does Max Reads (GTEx) mean?,"We report the maximum number of reads observed in any one sample for each splicing event, across samples from GTEx. We report only for GTEx samples as these are all healthy samples unlike SRA/Intropolis which may have misleading outliers. If the max reads of annotated splicing is low (<250) we recommend not excluding any events missing from 40K-RNA as it could just be due to poor read depth."
Can I export the data?,"To export the table you've generated, click either copy or download and select file type. If you are planning to open the file in Excel, we recommend the 'Excel' format so that the 'Exons skipped' column doesn't get converted to dates. 

To download the 40K-RNA database see (https://storage.googleapis.com/misspl-db-data/misspl_events_40k_hg19.sql.gz)."
How do I open IGV links?,"In your IGV desktop app, go to Preferences > Advanced & check Enable Port with Port number 60151. You may need to restart IGV after enabling.

IGV must be open when the link is clicked for it to work, and will open so that the donor and acceptor used in the splice junction are at both edges of the screen."
Why does SpliceVault-40K freeze after a few minutes?,We’re hosting SpliceVault-40k on shinyapps.io; which pauses the website if not used for 10 minutes or more (to save computing costs). You can simply click “reload” and continue your analysis
How do I cite SpliceVault-40K?,"Dawes, R., Joshi, H. & Cooper, S.T. Empirical prediction of variant-activated cryptic splice donors using population-based RNA-Seq data. Nat Commun 13, 1655 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-29271-y"
